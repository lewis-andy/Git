# Git
This is a python script for my git hub. It is used to perform the following functions.
1. git add .
2. git commit -m 'message'
3. git push
so basically the script first runs the git add . command on the terminal, it then runs the git commit command where it asks the user to enter       
the commit message on the terminal. Then finally the script runs the git push command to update the current working repository.
- was inspired to write this script since performing this operation was tiresome
